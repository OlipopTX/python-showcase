# Plan

This repository is a portfolio-ready collection of basic Python scripts and examples. To make it recruiter-friendly and technically polished, we plan to:

* Add example scripts in a `scripts/` directory (data structures, string utilities, file I/O).
* Improve the README with clear sections: description, features, setup instructions, usage examples, and license.
* Create a `requirements.txt` file if any dependencies are added.
* Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run code formatting checks (Black, Ruff) and tests using pytest on pushes and pull requests.
* Enable Dependabot and security scanning alerts.
* Turn on branch protection for `main` to require pull requests and passing checks.

These steps will ensure the repository demonstrates best practices and looks professional to recruiters.
