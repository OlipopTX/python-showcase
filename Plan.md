# Plan for python-showcase

This repository is intended to serve as a recruiter‑friendly portfolio of Python code examples. The current state includes only a `.gitignore`, a MIT license, and a minimal README. To make it more appealing and technically credible, the following actions are planned:

* **Add example scripts:** Create a `scripts/` directory containing small, well‑documented Python files showcasing data structures, string manipulation, file I/O, and a simple test file using `pytest`.
* **Improve README:** Expand the README with clear sections (Overview, Contents, Setup, Running Examples, License) without emojis or hyphens. Include instructions on how to run the example scripts.
* **Set up CI:** Add a GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run `pytest` and linting (`black` and `ruff`) on pushes and pull requests.
* **Add `requirements.txt`:** Include any dependencies needed for the examples (if any) to make setup straightforward.
* **Configure linters and formatters:** Set up `black` and `ruff` configuration files to enforce consistent code style.
* **Enable Dependabot and branch protection:** Ensure security and reliability by enabling Dependabot and requiring passing CI checks on the main branch.

These improvements will make the repository useful for demonstrating coding proficiency, with clean documentation and automation in place.
